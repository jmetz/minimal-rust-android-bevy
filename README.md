# Overview 

This is an extension of my 
[minimal rust android workflow](https://github.com/jmetz/minimal-rust-android-workflow-without-java)
to build a toy bevy game, which is also presented [using `cargo-mobile2` 
here](https://github.com/jmetz/cargo-mobile2-bevy-example). 

See the minimal repo above for prerequisites etc.

**Note: this is a learning project; tools such as 
[`cargo-mobile2`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/cargo-mobile2) and 
[`xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-mobile/xbuild) 
are much better ways of getting started with rust on android development.**
